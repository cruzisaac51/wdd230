                            <p>Mayra has just moved to Puerto Rico and a friend has told her that the "yunke" is very beautiful and a place to spend the weekend in the natural with beautiful landscapes, rivers and waterfalls. She decides to investigate the
                                place and it worries her a little since people complain about how dangerous that place is when it is raining so she has the need to check on the website when is the best day to visit that park</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Heribay plans a trip to Chicago to see his favorite football team. His trip will be with his wife and 8-month-old son, so he is a little worried about the weather since his young son cannot be exposed to such cold climates.
                                Heribay's favorite team will show up 3 times during the following year so he needs to see the best date for his trip since he doesn't have the exact date yet but he would like to be able to go and enjoy those days with
                                his family and see his team instead. Favorite for that he will use the best weather website.</p>

                            <p>Heribay has been working in the hospital for 24 hours and it is time to leave, Heribay on this day did not see the sunlight and he is worried about what the weather will be like outside, so he looks at the weather site to see
                                what kind of environmental conditions await him outside and be able to know whether to put on a coat or take out the umbrella to be able to go home to rest</p>

                                home she felt a little sick because of the weather, Mayra really needs a website where she can visualize the weather for the next few days to be able to organize herself so that this does not happen again and to be able
                                to enjoy a pleasant walk and calm</p>
